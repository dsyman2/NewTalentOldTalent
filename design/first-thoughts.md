We should make a cool website so that companies can post coding contracts that coders (not necessairly but maybe poorer countries) can bid on and take. there seems to be such a demand for it
like https://www.freelancer.com/work/programming-contract-bid/

but better
... didn't I suggest that like last week? ðŸ˜› And yes I agree completely.
ha you suggested some open marketplace
I was thinking that we could call it NewTalentOldTalent.
i cant remember the specific
That was a different idea.
but i think very specific for coding contracts'
no after the gamemarket you suggested a job market thing
Yes! That is what I suggested.
but i just dont remember the specifics
ha
fine, well now its my idea ðŸ˜›
Yes. The job market is the contract thing.
ok!
I was thinking that we should use a Stackoverflow style. Where you get reputation.
Rather than pay2win.
there are sooooo many companies look for contract coding work and so many overseas coders looking for contracts. but i would prefer that the site handles the payment so its not shady
Because that stop new people from getting into the market.
like now im looking for contracts but im always hesitant about how the pay is handled
Yes definety. We could provide a contract guarentee. Freelancer handles the payment ... but there is no quality control.
I think companies should get voted up or down based on whether they bother to explain the project or not.
it would be best if the hiring company locks in the pay, which is released to the employee like a week after the contract is completed. that gives the hirer a week to dispute it. if its disputed then the money is locked until the site investigates
As well as if you submit a usefull bid.
sort of how ebay and paypal used to work. they basically held the money as a middle man until everything was agreed after and they chose who gets the money
Yeah ... what is that called ... escrow.
we should look into it
ðŸ˜€ I like the idea a lot.
also, have the jobs im applying for are asking if i have experience with checkouts and other ecommerce systems
half*
so some sort of market site would add great to our resume even if no one used it
I would like to separate the website based on Old and New talent though ... like if you want to pay less but train someone ... go to New Talent ... or if you want someone with lots of skills go to Old Talent.
sure
And I would like to encourage people to grow there account (and not create a new one every time). 
For instance you could require 10 xp before you are allowed to post anything ..?
Do you use StackOverflow at all? Like that.
i read it a lot but i dont have an account
It ends up self-moderating really well.
we would need verification systems and stuff to prove who people are
People with high rank get more options.
Yes. And really good security.
ha ok
probably you should be the head of this company ðŸ˜›
I think we should also allow people to comment and interact with each others posts ... like suggest improvements or edits (maybe in a separate but attached forum).
Sure?
I am fairly passionate about the problem.
we definitly need a free review system that is uneditable (unless a review is contested in which case we decide)
But my business sense is not so great.
Check out how stack overflow works.
well it would be great to have 2 projects to work on
especialy while im unemployed
since sometimes i get burned out on the game and need a week or two off
Hah ðŸ™‚ yeah it would help us be more flexible and learn to reause code.
Yeah ... I just took a couple days.
hopefully it's designed with different systems so i get more practice on different code
I'm actually working more hours  a week tutoring now though.
thats good!
We could write it in a nother language?
Like Ruby or PHP ..?
ha that might be good
ive literally only ever written in python
But it is a slog.
ive never ever ever written any project in another language
I've tried a couple times ..
i want to have a github project in another language for my resume
It is the debugging that fucks you ... I'm really good at guession where I went wrong in Python but terrible in other langueages.
Ruby is nice ... PHP is well everywhere. It actually looks really easy.
PHP is more marketable ... fuck it ðŸ˜› I would prefer Ruby.
ha. well its 100% up to you
.. maybe we could do both?
PHP takes no overhead ... like you can get started in like 5 min. Just everything I have heard about PHP suggests that it is really easy to write shitty code ... which we probably don't want y'know?
PHP is like the opposite of Python.
When would you want to start?
anytime. but it would be more of a business venture than anything since even if we only had 1 bid on the site there would still be money flowing through, so we should discuss that. but since im pretty incompetent we should be "partners" but where you are like 80% of the site and make the choices and ill just help out where i can. i mainly just want to try out another language and ill be crazy slow. also, i want to try to put more into the game as the stuff we've been doing recently is hard for me so i havent been adding much
right now im looking up some other freelancer sites but i dont really like any of them
51-49
like the one i sent you. you can bid on up to 8 contracts a month unless you buy a membership, then its unlimited. thats so stupid
I don't like the style ... they are all pay2win. I don't think that encourages new talent. I want a place that is both a learning space and an earning space.
the amount of bids you can do should be based on: (a) how long you've been a member (b) your rating

so new or shitty rated members dont just bid on everything. no membership fees  for biddders
It is just a way to gouge people. And especially to take advantage of the poorest of the poor.
Yes. Based on rank.
i think all the site's income should come from the companies that are posting their contracts
Or XP.
freelancer takes 3% of each bid (or $3 if the bid is really small). that seems reasonable. its the people bidding being forced to buy memberships to get many bids in that is stupid
It really isn't when you do the math.
as a new member you should just have a few bids, so you need to bid low to get some contracts. then you prove your worth after even just 1 or 2 contracts and you can start bidding more
Plus they charge exchange fees.
ya they are all shit. but as long as money comes from the companies and not the poor employees then im fine with whatever fees you want
I think it should be free for small contracts and take fixed rate for larger ones. I think we should try and build something that is self sustaining and makes a reasonable amount of money ... rather than taking all the money.
Ok!
well the problem i already see on this site is its absolutely crammed with shitty small projects. so maybe id keep a fee for those
That is what I was thinking a bit. Like charge a Posting fee ... but don't charge people to bid or get paid.
90% of their contracts are some little company wanting a webpage made for them for $20
I think of it as a gateway problem ðŸ™‚ Like get people started ... then they will want a bigger project.
And the explainations are total garbage. They make no sense half the time or are just spam.
That is why I think it would make sense to require a certain amount of XP before making your first post. Make it a long term thing.
I think it would be cool to allow more experience Programers to subcontract bigger project to newer programmers ... thus building the experience of new users.
i also want a "discussion board" on each contract. so the bidders can ask questions and everyone can see the answers
Yes!
and the contracter should have like 24 hours to reply
so they cant just avoid hard questions
that way their is a record of their answers before you take the job. and if they vaguely answer it is a warning to the bidder
I would like it if you could separate it out so that other contracters can get points for improving the inital post (contract) by someone else.
Sounds good to me.
ok! but today we should hit up our abil/attr/prof/item rework
if you are finished up the thing you were working on yesterday
Nah ... I'm stuck ... I have some kind of Infinite recursion bug ...
I was just debugging it when we started talking.
ha ok
thats fine! i have work i neeed to do
look how shitty these job postings are
like an 11 word description of the contract. nothing else
but this porn site one is great
Ha.
Even that last one is pretty bare.
yes... work with me to create bots
like literally nothing else
Like they have no idea how big a project that might be. I think it would be interesting if you could post in the (Employer section) and asked for feedback about if your description was good enough. When you had enough votes you could then post your project.
this is the only one that actually looks fun/useful
Oh ok ðŸ™‚
make a function that adds text onto images
That sound more reasonable.
I think it would be interesting (in the far future) to try and eliminate (or nearly) exchange rate fees using bitcoin.
Basically the site would keep an amount in each currency that the workers normally use and only exchange large amounts occasionally through the bitcoin network.
Then the site would sink the exchange rate using larger transfers.
Like buying in bulk.
Which sounds better:
NewTalentOldTalent
or
OldTalenNewTalent
OldTalentNewTalent
ha i dont know
seems too long as a url
oldnewtalent
i cant help with names. im awful at thinking of stuff like that
this site doesnt even convert currency for me. so i have to manually convert each one to find out how much CAD it is
it should just display all currency in your local currency
Yes I know doesn't that suck orc cock?
It is because it sounds higher since they charge exchange fees on top of everything else.
ha
well we wont!! or at least shove them to the contractor. we should just pay the bidder what they see. and they should see it in their chosen currency

Feel free to add a readme or any kind of Design folder.
ha ok!
https://github.com/klondikemarlen/NewTalentOldTalent/invitations
just let me know which things to work on and ill try to get it done. you can assign any issues and whatnot to me
Sure ðŸ™‚
I first want to copy all our ideas from here into there.
makes sense ðŸ˜€
I jsut can't work out how to creat folders yet ðŸ˜›
lol
what a hurdle! our project is stumped
Ok. I found it.
